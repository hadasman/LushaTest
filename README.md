## Lusha Data Engineer coding assignment

###  Part 1 (python/ pyspark)

Submitted are 4 python files, where EntryPoint.py is the program that should be run. Results are printed when the program is run.

    
###  Part 2 (python) 

Submitted is a maven project (written in scala). Main code is in file "src/main/scala/kafka/KafkaTest".

Since I had not worked with Kafka before, and had some technical issues with using kafka, I decided to write the program to the best of my knowledge, using scala. Probably the same concept can easily be generalized to python, but for lack of time and experience with Kafka I went with what I was most confortable with (with kafka- scala).

------------

###  Part 3 (sql) 

Submitted is a .sql file with the required SQL code and the results it provides. This was checked and run on SparkSQL interpreter (what was available to me). 

This assume the csv files were loaded into the database as tables. 

------------

**Good luck!**
